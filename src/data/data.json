            "description": "In the talk \"Unvanished Native,\" Bently Spang presents recent works that are central to his commitment as an artist to reclaiming his Indigenous identity and re-expressing a Native-sourced definition of his experience. Spang uses the historical artmaking methodologies, and sometimes re-imagined art forms of his people, to explore issues of cultural continuity and debunk the \"mythology of the vanished\" created for his and many other Native communities. Bently Spang is a multidisciplinary artist, writer, curator, and educator. An enrolled member of the Tsitsistas/Suhtai Nation (a.k.a. Northern Cheyenne) in Montana, he works in a variety of media including video, mixed media sculpture, performance, photography, and installation. His work confronts and confounds the persistent, romantic, and inaccurate role crafted for Native peoples in the false narrative of \"The West.\" His work has been exhibited and collected widely in North America, South America, and Europe. Learn more about the artist at www.bentlyspang.com This talk is part of a series about Indigenous Art and Culture. Join us at all four: 9/21: Bently Spang | 10/9: Judy Watson (Virtual) | 10/19: Nicky Michael & Camilla Townsend | 11/16: Alan Michelson",

Since then, however, scholars have shown how this particular extremist group - one among many ultraist socio-political formations active worldwide - should in fact be considered hyper-modern in its use of futuristic-nostalgic rhetoric, astutely crafted visual messaging, and vast portfolio of media and communication technologies. As of late, however, ISIS has been outstripped in sheer production and online presence by right-wing political groups in Europe and the United States, such as Identity Evropa, Alternativ f\u00fcr Deutschland, Act for America, and Stop Islamization of America. A close analysis of the rhetorical and visual production of these Euro-American extremist and hate groups reveals not a diametric clash with ISIS\u2019s own output but rather a concurrence in symbolic lexica, in which, above all, a new form of Orientalism - of anathemizing the perceived other - is asserted to craft and entrench a nativist stance. This \u201cborder security\u201d stance involves a range of identity-based taxonomic simplifications as well as a calculated visual instrumentalization of fears linked to migration, miscegenation, and misogyny. Dr. Christiane Gruber is Professor of Islamic Art and Former Chair in the History of Art Department at the University of Michigan as well as Founding Director of Khamseen: Islamic Art History Online. Her scholarly work (available here) explores medieval to contemporary Islamic art, especially figural representation, depictions of the Prophet Muhammad, manuscripts and book arts, architecture, and modern visual and material cultures. Her two most recent publications include The Praiseworthy One: The Prophet Muhammad in Islamic Texts and Images and The Image Debate: Figural Representation in Islam and Across the World, and her public-facing essays have appeared in Newsweek, The Conversation, New Lines, Jadaliyya, and Prospect Magazine, among others.",

We also do ice breakers, attempt to use our signs in casual conversation, and play games like telephone, charades, and ASL jeopardy!! We are a safe space to learn some ASL, make some mistakes along the way, and hopefully make a friend too :) Every week on Tuesdays from 8 pm-9 pm!

One of Douglass' oldest traditions, the Sacred Path ceremony recognizes student achievement and fosters Douglass's unique community. Join your fellow Douglass classmates, alumnae, friends, and family as each class is honored with a symbol representing the different class years. After you receive your charm, head to the ceremonial fires on the sacred path to make a wish!  Students should show their pride by wearing their class year colors (first years wear white, sophomores wear pink, juniors wear red, and seniors wear black). Every student will receive a charm, a token representing her class. All Douglass students, family, faculty, and alumnae are welcome! Refreshments will be provided at Ludwig immediately following the ceremony.  *Students in Knowledge & Power will receive 2 points towards their Douglass event requirements* ",
