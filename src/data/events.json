We're coming to your campus with an interactive workshop session where you will have a chance to learn how to smell from a 'professional nose', have a chance to hear from panelists about their experiences in the industry and why they love it. We'll also hold a round table at the end of the workshop so you'll have a chance to ask your questions about a career in the fragrance industry. We hope to see you there!",

We will be opening multiple BOXES of the new cards, and distributing the individual packs equally to all attendees. First come, first serve!  We will then begin the draft process, where you will be able to trade your cards and build your team. If you've never participated in a draft before, we will guide you through the process, and help you make the best decisions for your starting deck. Finally (time permitting), you'll get to test out your new deck against other attendees in your own games!  Whether you are a veteran player, or are looking to get into the game, this event is for you!  Some light snacks will also be available.",
