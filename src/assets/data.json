Demystifying processes and dispelling myths is the way to dismantle barriers to awards and engage all students.    Knowing where to start can be a struggle when it comes to finding and identifying the best award opportunity. However, understanding the purpose of an award, the time commitment, and figuring out why you want it, will assist you in beginning an application process. This workshop will facilitate students in analyzing their own goals, deciding which award is best for them, and the pathway to pursuing an award opportunity as a gateway to others and potentially a future career. Join us to choose your path. It\u2019s your time to shine! All sessions of the series will be virtual, livestreamed and recorded via Zoom. All registrants will receive the Zoom link before the event.   Event Recordings: All Fall 2023 virtual Global Awards programming will be recorded, and the recordings will be shared in this folder (NYU login required).  Please allow 2-3 business days for the recording to be made available.    _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ *Note on Accessibility: New York University and the NYU Office of Global Awards provide reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities. For any questions or to notify us of additional accommodation requests, please email the Office of Global Awards at globalawards@nyu.edu at least one week prior to the event.",

Demystifying processes and dispelling myths is the way to dismantle barriers to awards and engage all students.    When chasing your dreams, it\u2019s important for others to know what drives you and what keeps you going. More importantly, you should know what gives you strength and motivation. This workshop will help students identify aspects of Imposter Syndrome and how their motivators honor their intentions to combat the lingering feeling of not being good enough and not belonging. All sessions of the series will be virtual, livestreamed and recorded via Zoom. All registrants will receive the Zoom link before the event.   Event Recordings: All Fall 2023 virtual Global Awards programming will be recorded, and the recordings will be shared in this folder (NYU login required).  Please allow 2-3 business days for the recording to be made available.    _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ *Note on Accessibility: New York University and the NYU Office of Global Awards provide reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities.

In the session Race & Identity in the United States, we explore the history of U.S. race relations, racism, and U.S. identity from past to present. This session will unpack the assumptions about race and identity international students bring with them to the U.S., while also providing a space to understand how international students are navigating their own racial identity within the U.S. context. In addition to providing key terminology and antiracism concepts, this session will also cover available resources and support at NYU for further engagement with this topic. This session will consist of a presentation and interactive dialogues with session participants.",

Demystifying processes and dispelling myths is the way to dismantle barriers to awards and engage all students.    While your CV/Resume is only one part of an application package, it\u2019s often the first impression you make on others. This workshop will guide students in synthesizing their experiences to consolidate them in their CV/Resume, while also presenting them in a way that serves their goals for applying to an award, in addition to illustrating preparedness for future career goals. All sessions of the series will be virtual, livestreamed and recorded via Zoom. All registrants will receive the Zoom link before the event.   Event Recordings: All Fall 2023 virtual Global Awards programming will be recorded, and the recordings will be shared in this folder (NYU login required).  Please allow 2-3 business days for the recording to be made available.    _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ *Note on Accessibility: New York University and the NYU Office of Global Awards provide reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities.

Demystifying processes and dispelling myths is the way to dismantle barriers to awards to engage all students.   Building relationships and networking is essential in our career progression. Having recommenders who know you and your work will make you stand out in the application process. This is the time to reflect on the relationships you\u2019ve made with professors, supervisors, university officials, and others who can substantiate your strengths, readiness, and candidacy for an award. In this workshop, Office of Global Awards staff will review how to identify, build and maintain your network, and how you can facilitate the kind of recommendation you need in line with what an application specifies. All sessions of the series will be virtual, livestreamed and recorded via Zoom. All registrants will receive the Zoom link before the event.   Event Recordings: All Fall 2023 virtual Global Awards programming will be recorded, and the recordings will be shared in this folder (NYU login required).  Please allow 2-3 business days for the recording to be made available.    _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ *Note on Accessibility: New York University and the NYU Office of Global Awards provide reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities.

Demystifying processes and dispelling myths is the way to dismantle barriers to awards and engage all students.    Winning award opportunities isn\u2019t only about a high GPA and leading the team. It\u2019s also about what you contribute; your strengths and experiences with navigating challenges; demonstrating reflective development, evolving from one opportunity to prepare for the next. This workshop will help students evaluate their \u201ctoolbox\u201d (i.e. collection of academic & professional work and personal interests/passions) to pinpoint unique expertise, identify areas for growth, and showcase well-rounded skill sets and accomplishments in an award application and the essays. All sessions of the series will be virtual, livestreamed and recorded via Zoom. All registrants will receive the Zoom link before the event.   Event Recordings: All Fall 2023 virtual Global Awards programming will be recorded, and the recordings will be shared in this folder (NYU login required).  Please allow 2-3 business days for the recording to be made available.    _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ *Note on Accessibility: New York University and the NYU Office of Global Awards provide reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities. For any questions or to notify us of additional accommodation requests, please email the Office of Global Awards at globalawards@nyu.edu at least one week prior to the event.",
